                        Swaminarayan was born on 3 April 1781 (Chaitra Sud 9, Samvat 1837) in Chhapaiya, a village near
                        Ayodhya in present-day Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.[1] Born into the Brahmin or priestly caste
                        of
                        Sarvariya, Swaminarayan was named Ghanshyam Pande by his parents, Hariprasad Pande (father, also
                        known as Dharmadev) and Premvati Pande (mother, also known as Bhaktimata and Murtidevi).[1] The
                        birth of Swaminarayan coincided with the Hindu festival of Rama Navami, celebrating the birth of
                        Rama. The ninth lunar day in the fortnight of the waxing moon in the month of Chaitra
                        (March–April),
                        is celebrated as both Rama Navami and Swaminarayan Jayanti by Swaminarayan followers. This
                        celebration also marks the beginning of a ritual calendar for the followers.[21]

                        A Swaminarayan sectarian legend tells how Narayana from the Nara Narayana pair, was cursed by
                        sage
                        Durvasa to incarnate on the earth as Swaminarayan.[22]

                        Swaminarayan had an elder brother, Rampratap Pande, and a younger brother, Ichcharam Pande.[23]
                        He
                        is said to have mastered the scriptures, including the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Puranas, the
                        Ramayana, and the Mahabharata by the age of seven.[24]

                    <p>
                        According to Swaminarayan-tradition, Sahajanand Swami was later known as Swaminarayan after the
                        mantra he taught at a gathering, in Faneni, a fortnight after the death of Ramanand Swami.[38]
                        He gave his followers a new mantra, known as the Swaminarayan mantra, to repeat in their
                        rituals: Swaminarayan.[33] When chanting this mantra, some devotees went into samadhi,[39][note
                        1] and claimed that they could see their personal gods.[28][40][41] Swaminarayan also became
                        known by the names Ghanshyam Maharaj, Shreeji Maharaj, Hari Krishna Maharaj and Shri
                        Hari.[citation needed]

                        As early as 1804, Swaminarayan, who was reported to have performed miracles, was described as a
                        manifestation of God in the first work written by a disciple and paramahamsa, Nishkulanand
                        Swami.[33][42][note 2] This work, the Yama Danda, was the first piece of literature written
                        within the Swaminarayan sect.[44] Swaminarayan himself is said to have intimated that he was a
                        manifestation of God in a meeting with Reginald Heber, the Lord Bishop of Calcutta, in
                        1825.[45]: 81 

                        Some of Swaminarayan's followers believe he was an incarnation of Krishna.[43] The images and
                        stories of Swaminarayan and Krishna have coincided in the liturgy of the sect. The story of the
                        birth of Swaminarayan parallels that of Krishna's birth from the scripture Bhagavata Purana.[46]
                        Most of his followers believe that Swaminarayan is the complete manifestation of Narayana or
                        Purushottama Narayana - the Supreme Being and superior to other avatars.[33]

                        The belief of many followers that their founder was the incarnation of the Supreme God has also
                        drawn criticism.[47] According to Professor Raymond B. Williams, Swaminarayan was criticized
                        because he received large gifts from his followers and dressed and traveled as a Maharaja even
                        though he had taken the vows of renunciation of the world. Swaminarayan responded that he
                        accepts gifts for the emancipation of his followers.[48]

                        Swaminarayan encouraged his followers to combine devotion and dharma to lead a pious life. Using
                        Hindu texts and rituals to form the base of his organisation, Swaminarayan founded what in later
                        centuries would become a global organisation with strong Gujarati roots.[49] He was particularly
                        strict on the separation of sexes in temples.[50] Swaminarayan was against the consumption of
                        meat, alcohol or drugs, adultery, suicide, animal sacrifices, criminal activities and the
                        appeasement of ghosts and tantric rituals.[51][52][53][54] Alcohol consumption was forbidden by
                        him even for medicinal purposes.[55] Many of his followers took vows before becoming his
                        disciple. He stated that four elements need to be conquered for ultimate salvation: dharma,
                        bhakti (devotion), gnana (knowledge) and vairagya (detachment).[4] Doctrinally, Swaminarayan was
                        close to eleventh century philosopher Ramanuja and was critical of Adi Shankara's concept of
                        Advaita, or monistic non-dualism. Swaminarayan's ontology maintained that the supreme being is
                        not formless and that God always has a divine form.[56] Swaminarayan's philosophy asserts that
                        Parabrahman and Aksharabrahman are two distinct eternal realities.[57]
